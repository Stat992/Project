The "external" data used here was the Medicare Physician and Other Supplier NPI Aggregate and Detailed tables found at  [the CMS website](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Physician-and-Other-Supplier2013.html). The tables were well organized by NPI and contain columns of categorical and numerical data to be analyzed.
